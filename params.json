{"name":"Intellikid","tagline":"Coding Standards & Best Practices","body":"### 2016  SLIIT Software Engineering WeekEnd batch group 011 \r\n\r\nThe goal of these guidelines is to create uniform coding habits among software personnel in the\r\nIntelliKid development team so that reading, checking, and maintaining code written by different persons\r\nbecomes easier. The intent of these standards is to define a natural style and consistency, yet leave\r\nto the authors of the source code, the freedom to practice their craft without\r\nunnecessary burden. All developers in the project must adhere to these coding practices.\r\n\r\n## Variable Naming\r\n* Use all lower case letters\r\n* Use '_' as the word separator.\r\n* Global variables should be prepended with a 'g'.\r\n* Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.\r\n* Static variables may be prepended with 's'.\r\n\r\n## Function Definitions\r\n\r\nFunction definitions should adhere to the \"BSD/Allman style\"\r\n\r\n`    function fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '') {`\r\n      `if (condition) {`\r\n        `statement;`\r\n      `}`\r\n      `return $val;`\r\n    `}`\r\n","google":"UA-000000-01","note":"Don't delete this file!
