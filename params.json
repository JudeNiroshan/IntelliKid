{"name":"Intellikid","tagline":"Coding Standards & Best Practices","body":"### 2016  SLIIT Software Engineering WeekEnd batch group 011 \r\n\r\nThe goal of these guidelines is to create uniform coding habits among software personnel in the\r\nIntelliKid development team so that reading, checking, and maintaining code written by different persons\r\nbecomes easier. The intent of these standards is to define a natural style and consistency, yet leave\r\nto the authors of the source code, the freedom to practice their craft without\r\nunnecessary burden. All developers in the project must adhere to these coding practices.\r\n\r\n## Variable Naming\r\n* Use all lower case letters\r\n* Use '_' as the word separator.\r\n* Global variables should be prepended(starts) with a 'g'.\r\n* Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.\r\n* Static variables may be prepended(starts) with a 's'.\r\n\r\n## Function Definitions\r\n* Function names should starts with a lowercase letter.\r\n* Use camel case style.\r\n* Function definitions should adhere to the \"BSD/Allman style\"\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    function fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '') {\r\n      if (condition) {\r\n        statement;\r\n      }\r\n      return $val;\r\n    }\r\n</pre>\r\nPlease note the placement of the curly braces. \r\n\r\n##Comments\r\n* C style comments (/* */) and standard C++ comments (//) are both fine. Use of Perl/shell style comments (#) is discouraged.","google":"UA-000000-01","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
